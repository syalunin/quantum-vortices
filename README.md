# Quantum vortices

This repository provides tools for solving the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation arising in a wide range of applications, ranging from Bose-Einstein condensation of ultracold atoms and superconductivity to superfluid-related cosmic phenomena.

### Features
- Real and imaginary time evolution
- Calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors

### Prerequisites
The following tools must to be installed in order to compile the project:
- Intel Fortran and C++ compilers
- GLFW version 3.4 or newer
- OpenGL version 4.1
- Intel MKL
- Arpack-ng

### Building
To generate the executables, run the `make` command in the root directory.

### Gallery

Here are some pictures to illustrate the project: (top) formation of a hexagonal lattice of vortices in the Bose Einstein condensate and (bottom) the eigenstates of a harmonic oscillator.
